#  CROSSY ROADS ‚Äì 3D Endless Runner in OpenGL

> A Computer Graphics Project developed using OpenGL and GLUT in C++  
> Developed as part of UCS505 - Computer Graphics  
> **By:** Yash Saxena, Madhur Mahajan, Nikhil Garg  
> **Institution:** Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology

##  Project Overview

**CROSSY ROADS** is a 3D endless runner game inspired by the popular "Crossy Roads" concept. The objective is to control a cube-shaped character and avoid dynamic and static obstacles while navigating a path that dynamically generates itself.

---

##  Key Features

- **Player Movement**: W/A/S/D keys for rolling; Spacebar + direction for jumping
- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Includes spinning, rising, falling, and moving cubes
- **Multiple Camera Views**: Isometric, Top-down, Side, and First-Person
- **Graphics**: Real-time 3D rendering using OpenGL (lighting, shading, materials)
- **Score System**: Distance-based score displayed on HUD
- **Skybox & Grid**: Enhances the environment visually

## About Project 
Working on CROSSY ROADS was an exciting journey into the world of computer graphics. Implementing real-time rendering, obstacle logic, and interactive controls using OpenGL taught me a lot about game development fundamentals. It was both a challenging and rewarding experience that strengthened my problem-solving and programming skills.
